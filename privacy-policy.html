        <span>
          SHIFT44™ will never share, sell, rent, exchange or barter your personal information to or with any third party
          for financial gain or marketing purposes. By making that personal information available to SHIFT44™, you grant
          SHIFT44™ the right, subject to applicable law, to use that personal information to contact you regarding your
          use of the SHIFT44™ Offerings and/or other SHIFT44™ products and/or services that we think may be of interest
          to you. If you wish to stop receiving future communications from us, please follow the instructions at the end
          of each such e-mail message or see the “Opt-Out/Unsubscribe” section below.
          Where you submit personal information, we use the personal information that you make available to personalize
          your experience with the Site and to facilitate the provision of the applicable SHIFT44™ Offerings to you,
          including in connection with customer service and to otherwise respond to any inquiries made by you. You also
          agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information that we may deem
          appropriate for you to receive in connection with your continued use of the SHIFT44™ Offerings.
          We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples
          include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from User lists, analyzing data and
          providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to
          our Users’ personal information as needed to perform these functions for us, but we do not permit them to use
          User personal information for other purposes.
          We may also use your personal information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our
          service offerings including, without limitation, the SHIFT44™ Offerings. We may also combine the information
          we have gathered about you with information from other sources.
          By submitting your personal information by and through the SHIFT44™ Offerings, you agree that such act
          constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et
          seq.), as amended from time to time (the “Rule”) and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such,
          notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List,
          and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in
          accordance with the Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.
          Where you provide “prior express consent” within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 USC
          § 227), and its implementing regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR § 64.1200),
          as amended from time-to-time (“TCPA”), you consent to receive telephone calls from SHIFT44™, including
          artificial voice calls, pre-recorded messages and/or calls (including SMS text messages) delivered via
          automated technology, to the telephone number(s) that you provided. Please note that you are not required to
          provide consent under the TCPA in order to obtain access to the SHIFT44™ Offerings, and your consent simply
          allows SHIFT44™ to contact you via these means. Please be advised that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you
          are obligated to immediately inform us if and when the telephone number that you have previously provided to
          us changes. Without limiting the foregoing, if you: (a) have your telephone number reassigned to another
          person or entity; (b) give up your telephone number so that it is no longer used by you; (c) port your
          telephone number to a landline or vice versa; or (d) otherwise stop using that telephone number for any reason
          (collectively “Phone Number Change”), you agree that you shall promptly notify SHIFT44™ of the Phone Number
          Change via e-mail at: notifications@shift44.com, or by using one of the methods set forth in the “Contact Us”
          section below.
          We reserve the right to release current or past personal information: (i) in the event that we believe that
          the SHIFT44™ Offerings are being or have been used in violation of any Site-related agreement or to commit
          unlawful acts; (ii) if the information is subpoenaed; provided, however, that, where permitted by applicable
          law, we shall provide you with e-mail notice, and opportunity to challenge the subpoena, prior to disclosure
          of any personal information pursuant to a subpoena; (iii) if we are sold, merge with a third-party or are
          acquired by a third-party (collectively, “M&A Transactions”) (including where we share your personal
          information in connection with the due diligence process associated with a potential M&A Transaction); or (iv)
          if we are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that if SHIFT44™ is involved in a
          bankruptcy proceeding, merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via
          e-mail and/or a prominent notice on the Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information,
          as well as any choices that you may have regarding your personal information.
          You hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third-party when we, in our sole
          discretion, determine the disclosure to be required by applicable law, including sharing your e-mail address
          with third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time
          to time, and other e-mail marketing laws. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S.
          Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be
          shared or transferred to third-parties without permission.

          Neither SHIFT44™, nor any third party, uses cookies, pixels or other tracking technology on the Site for

          mobile devices contain a “do-not-track” setting. In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the
          end-user’s Internet browser or mobile device notifies other websites or mobile applications that the end-user
          does not want her/his information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for behavioral

          We endeavor to safeguard and protect our Users’ personal information. When Users make personal information
          available to us, their personal information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we
          maintain any personal information offline). Where our registration/application process prompts Users to enter
          sensitive data (such as credit card information) and when we store and transmit such sensitive data, that
          personal information is encrypted with advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security).
          Access to your personal information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your
          personal information is not accessible to the public. All of our Users’ personal information is restricted in
          our offices, as well as the offices of our third-party service providers. Only employees or third-party agents
          who need User personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to User personal information.

          not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. The servers that we store User personal

          may gain access to certain portions of your personal information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches
          may cause inadvertent disclosures of your personal information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach
          the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software may constitute a crime
